# Introduction
This <b>Player Service</b> app provides simple APIs that serve the contents of `Player.csv`. It contains information regarding Baseball players.
The contest of `Player.csv` is integrated in in-memory H2 database.

You can:

- `GET /v1/players` - Fetch a list of all players
- `GET /v1/players/{id}` - Fetch a Player object based on `playerId`

In addition to serving the contents of `Player.csv`. Player service integrates with Ollama, which allows us to run LLMs locally. This app runs [`tinyllama`](https://ollama.com/library/tinyllama) model.
- `GET /v1/chat/list-models` -  List available LLM models
- `POST /v1/chat` - Chat with `tinyllama` model

## Technology Stack

- Java 17
- Maven
- Spring Boot 3.3.4 (with Spring Web MVC, Spring Data JPA)
- H2 Database
- Docker
- [Ollama4j SDK](https://ollama4j.github.io/ollama4j/intro)

## Project Structure

- `/collection` folder contains sample requests for player service.
- `/src`: Source code
    - `/config`: Configuration for Ollama4j library
    - `/controller`: API controllers
    - `/model`: Data models
    - `/repository`: Data repositories
    - `/service`: Service layer implementations
- `/player-service-model` folder contains a dummy AI model for `Player.csv` data. Additional information for this model can be found [here](player-service-model/README.md).

## Schema for PLAYERS table
The database connected to this service is `in-memory H2 Database`. On application start-up, `PLAYERS` table is created.

Here is the schema for `PLAYERS` table -

- `playerID`: A unique identifier for each player.
- `birthYear`,`birthMonth`, `birthDay`: The player‚Äôs birth date.
- `birthCountry`, `birthState`, `birthCity`: The location of the player‚Äôs birth.
- `deathYear`, `deathMonth`, `deathDay`, `deathCountry`, `deathState`, `deathCity`: The location and date of the player‚Äôs death. If this is empty, the player is still alive.
- `nameFirst`, `nameLast`, `nameGiven`: The player‚Äôs first name, last name, and given name.
- `weight`: The player‚Äôs weight in pounds.
- `height`: The player‚Äôs height in inches.
- `bats`: Indicates which hand the player bats with (R for right).
- `throws`: Indicates which hand the player throws with.
- `debut`: The date of the player‚Äôs debut game.
- `finalGame`: The date of the player‚Äôs final game.
- `retroID` and `bbrefID`: Unique IDs used by baseball reference systems (likely for linking to external player databases).

### Ollama setup ü¶ô

Player service integrates with Ollama, which allows us to run LLMs locally. This app runs [`tinyllama`](https://ollama.com/library/tinyllama) model.

1. Pull and run Ollama docker image and download `tinyllama` model
- Pull Ollama docker image
```shell
docker pull ollama/ollama
```
- Run Ollama docker image on port 11434
```shell
docker run -it -v ~/ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama ollama/ollama
```
- Download and run `tinyllama` model
```shell
docker exec -it ollama ollama run tinyllama
```

2. Test Ollama API server
```curl
curl -v --location 'http://localhost:11434/api/generate' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"model": "tinyllama","prompt": "why is the sky blue?", "stream": false}'
```

3. Run Player Service app
```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```
Call `GET /v1/chat/list-models`
```curl
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/list-models'
```

Response
```json
[
